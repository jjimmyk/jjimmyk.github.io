    <li>Standup straight, with both feet firmly planted on the ground.</li>
    <li>Place your hands on your stomach.</li>
    <li>Inhale deeply for 5 seconds, filling your belly with air instead of your chest. You should feel your belly inflate.</li>
    <li>Exhale for 10 seconds, feeling your belly deflate.</li>
    <li>Inhale deeply again, feeling your belly fill up with air.</li>
    <li>Produce one, single note and hold it as long as you can, using the air held in your belly to sustain the note.</li>
  </ol>
