  <ol>
   
    <li>While in shallow water next to your board, lay belly-down atop the board.</li>
    <li>Slowly inch your knees forward and move your arms backward until you are in a kneeling position.</li>
    <li>At this point, you should be kneeling atop the board. Detach the paddle from the board.</li>
    <li>Grasp the center of the paddle with your non-dominant hand, grasping the handle of the paddle with your dominant hand.</li>
    <li>Submerge the end piece of the paddle in the water on either side of the board.</li>
    <li>Pull the paddle backward to propel the board forward.</li>
    <li>Move the paddle to the opposite side of the board.</li>
    <li>Pull the paddle backward to propel the board forward.</li>
    <li>Repeat this process as necessary to move and steer the board as you wish.</li>
    <li>After you feel comfortable with moving and steering the board, quickly move one foot, quickly followed by the other foot, to a standing position. Keep your knees bent.</li>
    <li>Now you are standing on the board and may move and steer it throughout the water! Congrats!</li>
